# Admin Setup Guide

## üîß Setting Up Admin Access

### 1. Database Setup

First, you need to add the `role` column to your `profiles` table in Supabase:

```sql
-- Add role column to profiles table
ALTER TABLE profiles 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS role VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'customer';

-- Create index for better performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_profiles_role ON profiles(role);
```

### 2. Create Admin User

You can make any user an admin by updating their role in the database:

#### Option A: Update by Email
```sql
UPDATE profiles 
SET role = 'admin' 
WHERE email = 'your-admin-email@example.com';
```

#### Option B: Update by User ID
```sql
UPDATE profiles 
SET role = 'admin' 
WHERE id = 'USER_ID_HERE';
```

### 3. Admin Features

Once a user has the `admin` role, they will see:

#### Mobile App (React Native)
- **Admin Tab**: Special admin tab in bottom navigation
- **Admin Dashboard**: Overview with statistics

  'manager@example.com'
);
```

### Removing Admin Access
```sql
-- Remove admin access
UPDATE profiles 
SET role = 'customer' 
WHERE email = 'former-admin@example.com';
```
